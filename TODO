TODO
====

* Add unit tests for markdown_link_style.logging module.

  A good place to put the unit tests for this module is under
  ``tests/markdown_link_style/test_logging.py``.

* Add unit test for ``mdl_style.LSBlockLexer``,
  ``mdl_style.LSInlineLexer`` classes.

  * The unit tests for these classes must go under
  ``tests/test_mdl_style.py``.

  * The unit tests must simply check contents of ``default_rules``
    class variable.

* Add unit test for ``mdl_style.LSMarkdown``.

  The unit test must verify that the class variables ``renderer``,
  ``inline``, ``block`` are instances of ``mdl_style.LSRenderer``,
  ``mdl_style.InlineLexer`` and ``mdl_style.LSBlockLexer``
  respectively.

* Add unit tests for ``mdl_style.LSRenderer`` under
  ``tests.test_mdl_style.TestLSRendererIL`` and
  ``tests.test_mdl_style.TestLSRendererFN`` to verify that the
  renderer does not modify block/inline elements other than links and
  paragraphs.

  Specifically, unit tests must be added to verify that the following
  block/inline elements are not modified by the
  ``mdl_style.LSRenderer`` renderer:

  * Inline elements:

    * Emphasis
    * Code

  For instance, if the input contains ``## This is an H2``, the
  ``mdl_style.LSRenderer`` renderer must not change it to ``<h2>This
  is an H2</h2``; it must leave as is -- ``## This is an H2``.
