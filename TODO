TODO
====

* ``markdown_link_style.logging.MDLogger`` does not seem to handle all
  logging levels; look into this and fix it.

* Add unit test for ``mdl_style.LSBlockLexer``,
  ``mdl_style.LSInlineLexer`` classes.

  * The unit tests for these classes must go under
  ``tests/test_mdl_style.py``.

  * The unit tests must simply check contents of ``default_rules``
    class variable.

* Add unit test for ``mdl_style.LSMarkdown``.

  The unit test must verify that the class variables ``renderer``,
  ``inline``, ``block`` are instances of ``mdl_style.LSRenderer``,
  ``mdl_style.InlineLexer`` and ``mdl_style.LSBlockLexer``
  respectively.
